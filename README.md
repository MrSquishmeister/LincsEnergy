# LincsEnergy Web Scripting
### College project brief


The functionality of a website can be enhanced with server side scripting e.g. statistics, user login, file uploading. To explore these techniques you are required to build a set webpages and PHP scripts as prototypes of a dynamic website for a client. The website will allow the user to dynamically edit the contents of the website without the need for specialist training or coding knowledge.
The development of the site requires several core features and several extended features. Core features must be implemented by the deadline whereas extended features are to impress the client with your server scripting prowess.
